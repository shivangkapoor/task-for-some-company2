## Programming Task

In order to be considered for the developer position, you must complete the following task.

_Note: This task should take 2 - 3 hours at the most. However, you have up to 24hrs after you fork the repo to submit your work._

### Preparation

Before starting this task, we recommend that you have:

- Your favourite computer and development tools / IDE to hand;
- A few hours of un-distracted time ahead of you;
- Access to the internet;
- A mug of hot coffee (or tea, if you prefer!).

### In this task, you may use:

- Any combination of technologies, frameworks and techniques you like;
- The internet, including Google, Stackoverflow etc to help with the task;
- Any type of data store.

You may also ask us any general questions you might have about the task.

## The Task

1. Fork this repository on Github (if you don't know what that means or how to do it, Google is your friend);
2. Create a _src_ folder to contain your code;
3. In the _src_ directory, create a simple app to allow a basic Olympic Medals Table to be displayed in a browser or on a device;
4. The app should allow:

- Countries to be added to a table, along with the TOTAL number of medals the country won during the last Olympic Games; and
- Rows to be sorted in descending order of medals won, either automatically or manually by the user.

5. Commit and Push your code to your new repository;
6. Send us a pull request;
7. Your code will be reviewed by one of our senior technical team and we will get back to you.

If you wish to supply instructions on how to run or understand the construction of your app, then please provide those in a new README.md file within a docs folder.

If you can provide a link to view or download a demo of your app to go along with your code, then all the better.

#### _Feel free to use any combination of technologies, frameworks and techniques you prefer._

### For bonus points:

If you find the task above easy, then feel free to improve your app. Here are some ideas:

- Add counts for each type of medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze) and make the countries order by Gold first, Silver next and Bronze thereafter;
- Add country flag icons/images to the country names;
- Allow editing and/or deleting of countries from the list.

### Any questions?

Please just ask.

Good luck and thanks for taking the time to complete this task!
