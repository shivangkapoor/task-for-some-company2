# Rio 2016 table

### View site

The site is viewable at [https://olympics4bo.firebaseapp.com](https://olympics4bo.firebaseapp.com/)

### Instructions

It's just a create-react-app, so `npm install` to install deps, `npm start` to start dev and `npm build` for a production version

### What can I do?

- Sort by name of country, medal type and total medals
- Change names of countries and their medals, just click the cell
- You can't change the total because it wouldn't make sense
- It should re-sort when you change something
- You can add and remove countries, the red [x] in the last row to remove, the select box to add

### Also

All the data is scraped from the Wikipedia [2016 Summer Olympics medal table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics_medal_table) page.

The end.
